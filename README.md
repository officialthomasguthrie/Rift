# Rift

A portable operating system that runs from a USB drive, keeps its owner's data encrypted on that drive, and leaves the host computer's disks untouched.

## Overview

Rift is a general purpose desktop operating system designed to live on a portable drive rather than inside a particular computer. The drive holds two things that are kept strictly apart: a read-only system image that is verified as it is read, and an encrypted volume that holds everything belonging to the owner, including files, applications, AI models and per-machine settings.

Booted on a compatible PC, Rift uses that machine's processor, memory, graphics, display and network, and presents the same desktop, files and configuration on every computer it is used with. The internal disks of the host are not mounted, and nothing is written to them.

The system is assembled from nixpkgs with Nix, so each image is fully described by this repository and its lock file. Every component written for Rift is implemented in Rust.

## Features

### Immutable system and atomic updates

- The operating system is a read-only Nix store protected by dm-verity. A block that does not match its hash is refused rather than read.
- The drive carries two system slots. systemd-sysupdate writes a new version into the inactive slot, so the running version is never modified during an update.
- systemd-boot counts boot attempts for each new version. A version that fails to boot three times is set aside and the previous version starts again.
- Each version boots as a unified kernel image on UEFI firmware, with the current stable Linux kernel.

### Encrypted storage

- Personal data lives on a LUKS2 volume formatted with btrfs and zstd compression, divided into subvolumes by kind of data.
- The volume is created on the first boot of a newly written drive and unlocked with a passphrase at each boot after that.
- Memory pressure is absorbed by compressed RAM (zram). No swap space exists on the drive or on the host.
- An optional exFAT partition provides ordinary storage that Windows, macOS and other Linux systems can read without Rift.

### Snapshots, backup and cloning

- The home directory is snapshotted every hour with configurable retention, and individual files can be restored from any snapshot.
- Backups are encrypted and deduplicated with rustic, in the restic repository format, to an external disk.
- A complete, bootable copy of the drive can be written to a second drive, which receives an encryption key of its own.

### Desktop

- Horizon, a Wayland compositor derived from niri, arranges windows as columns on a horizontally scrolling strip for each display.
- Lens, the desktop shell, draws a top bar with the clock and a system menu for sound, brightness, wired and Wi-Fi networks, Bluetooth, the battery and the session; an applications menu that lists installed applications by category, with a search field that also runs system commands, evaluates Nushell pipelines and passes requests written in plain language to the local assistant; and a dock that holds pinned and running applications and the workspaces.
- A drop-down terminal and a lock screen are built into the compositor.
- Firefox, Ghostty, Zed, Helix, zellij, fish and Podman are included in the image.
- Flatpak is integrated with xdg-desktop-portal for applications installed from Flathub.

### Per-machine configuration

- Orbit identifies each host from its DMI and PCI identifiers and stores a profile for it on the encrypted volume. A machine that has been seen before is configured from its profile.
- On a machine it has not seen, it derives display scaling from the physical size reported by the monitor, selects a graphics path, and chooses an AI model tier suited to the available memory.
- Every host is classed as owned, trusted or borrowed. Internal disks are never mounted automatically.

### Local AI

- Quasar runs language models with llama.cpp on the host itself, using the GPU where one is usable and the CPU otherwise. No account, network connection or remote service is involved.
- Models from the Qwen3 family, licensed under Apache-2.0, are selected by tier according to host memory. Each model is declared with its checksum in `models/manifest.toml`, and weights are stored on the encrypted volume.
- An OpenAI-compatible API on `127.0.0.1:11434` makes the models available to local programs. Requests that originate from web pages are refused.
- A request made through the shell returns either an answer or a proposed action, and no action runs until it is confirmed.
- Files in the home directory can be searched by meaning rather than by exact wording, through an embedding index that is built and kept on the drive.

### Application sandboxing

- Command-line programs can be run in a bubblewrap sandbox confined by Landlock filesystem rules and a seccomp filter.
- A per-application network switch, implemented with nftables, removes network access from a sandboxed program.
- Flatpak applications run in their own sandboxes and reach the desktop through portals.

### Privacy

Rift contains no telemetry, requires no account, and depends on no online service to boot or to operate.

## Components

| Component | Function |
|---|---|
| Liftoff | System image, boot process and updates |
| Horizon | Wayland compositor |
| Lens | Desktop shell: top bar, menus and dock |
| Quasar | Local AI service and API |
| Orbit | Host detection and per-machine profiles |
| Airlock | Application sandboxing and network control |
| Vault | Snapshots, backup and cloning |
| rift-flash | Drive writer for Windows, macOS and Linux |
| librift | Shared library used by the tools above |

System services are exposed on D-Bus under `dev.rift.*`.

## Command line

The `rift` command reaches the same services as the desktop.

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `rift host` | Show the stored profile of the current machine |
| `rift ai` | Ask a question, or index and search the home directory by meaning |
| `rift doctor` | Check the drive, the host and the system services |
| `rift snapshot` | List, take and restore from snapshots |
| `rift backup` | List, make and restore from encrypted backups |
| `rift clone` | Write a complete second drive with a new key |
| `rift run --sandbox` | Run a command inside a sandbox |
| `rift net` | Turn network access off or on for a sandboxed application |

## System requirements

| | Minimum | Recommended |
|---|---|---|
| Processor | 64-bit x86 (x86-64) | A recent multi-core processor |
| Firmware | UEFI | UEFI |
| Memory | 4 GB | 8 GB or more |
| Drive capacity | 64 GB | 256 GB |
| Drive type | USB 3.0 flash drive | SSD-class USB drive, or an NVMe SSD in a USB 3.2 Gen 2 enclosure |

Secure Boot must currently be disabled in the firmware settings. Legacy BIOS, 32-bit processors and Apple Silicon Macs are not supported.

The drive determines most of the system's responsiveness. Low-cost flash drives will boot, but they are slow under the sustained random writes of a full operating system and wear out quickly.

## Installation

No release has been published yet. Installation images, together with their checksums, will be listed on the [releases page](https://github.com/officialthomasguthrie/Rift/releases) when the first version is available.

Drives are written with rift-flash, a graphical application and command-line tool for Windows, macOS and Linux. It only offers removable drives, and it refuses any disk that is internal, in use, or running the current system.

## Building from source

Building requires [Nix](https://nixos.org/download/) with flakes enabled. The image itself must be built on an x86_64-linux machine or through a remote builder of that type. The Rust workspace builds on Linux, macOS and Windows, apart from the compositor, which requires Linux.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/officialthomasguthrie/Rift.git
cd Rift

nix build .#image   # build the bootable disk image
just vm             # boot the image in QEMU with KVM

just build          # build the Rust workspace
just test           # run the test suite
just lint           # rustfmt and clippy
```

Every change to `main` is built and tested by continuous integration. The pipeline builds the full image and boots it in QEMU, then exercises unlocking, an update, a rollback, snapshots, a backup, a clone, the sandbox and the local AI inside the running system.
