//! Search by meaning, from the owner's side. An update walks home, cuts each text file into parts,
//! gets a vector for each part from Quasar and keeps them all in one index; a search gets a vector
//! for the words and ranks files by their closest part. Quasar turns text into vectors and never
//! reads home, whoever runs this does.
//!
//! The index is one flat file, little endian: [`HEADER`], the model's id, the number of dimensions,
//! then for each file its path relative to home, its modified time and size, and for each of its
//! parts the line the part starts on and the normalized vector.
