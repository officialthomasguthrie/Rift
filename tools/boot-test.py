"""Boots an image through the flake's vm app and checks that the system comes up. The image job in ci
runs this after it builds the image.

Usage: boot-test.py <rift-vm> <image> <passfile> [--models dir] [--exchange size] [--timeout 600]
       [--log serial.log] [--splash splash.png] [--desktop desktop.png] [--lens] [--updates updates.img]
       [--backup backup.img] [--clone clone.img] [--first-boot]

With --first-boot rift-flash writes the drive without persist, the way it writes one on macOS and
Windows, and the drive makes persist when it first starts. The test answers its questions over serial: a
passphrase that is too short and two that differ are asked for again, then the passphrase from the
passfile goes in twice. The drive goes on to the shell without asking again, and gets the checks below
up to the drive's own: the slots, luks2 with argon2id, the subvolumes, the owner's home and the exchange
partition. Persist has one key slot and the system runs with the machine id in @var. After a reboot the
drive asks systemd-cryptsetup's question, not the first boot's, and opens the same persist with the same
passphrase: the same uuids, machine id, key slots and partitions. The test ends there.

<rift-vm> is the program from `nix build .#vm` (result/bin/rift-vm). It writes the image, .raw or
.raw.zst, onto a drive in a file with rift-flash (through sudo), with the passphrase from the passfile
for persist, then boots the drive as an nvme drive. Everything goes through the serial console: the luks prompt,
the autologin shell, a few commands, the default apps on the path, the a/b slots, the host profile
orbit wrote and what `rift host` and `rift doctor` print. The serial output is printed as it
arrives and kept in the log file.

The first tier of apps: every app, tool and language in the image prints its version. gcc, clang, g++,
clang++, cmake with ninja, make, zig cc, rustc and go each build a program that runs, java runs one from
its source, and python, node and bun run a line. JAVA_HOME is the jdk in the image. libvirtd is not
running after the boot, starts when `virsh -c qemu:///system version` connects as the owner and names the
QEMU it runs guests with, and has UEFI firmware with secure boot for them.

Timeline: the test takes a snapshot of home with `rift snapshot take`, changes one file and
deletes another, finds the snapshot through `rift snapshot` and on the bus, and restores both from
it. The deleted file comes back as the owner's; the changed one stays as it is without --replace and
is the copy from the snapshot with it. The hourly timer's service runs once and adds a snapshot. Then
`vault prune` with one hour, one day and two weeks drops the snapshots named by hand for January that
fall past those limits and keeps the one that does not.

Backup: with --backup the vm gets another drive, an empty ext4 file system labelled backup. The test
mounts it, chooses a folder on it with `sudo vault target`, which prints the password, and unmounts it
again. `rift backup now` backs up home; vault mounts the disk by its uuid by itself. One file is
changed and another deleted, and both come back from the backup through `rift backup restore` the
way they do from a snapshot. Then the test mounts the disk again: rustic refuses the repository with a
wrong password and opens it with the printed one, and grep finds the file's text in none of its files.

Clone: with --clone the vm gets an empty scsi disk that says it is removable. Last of all the test
writes a file to home and runs `sudo rift clone`. Vault refuses the drive the system runs from, the
backup drive, which is not removable, and a serial that is not the disk's, and writes nothing. Then it
clones onto the removable disk with a passphrase of its own. Slot a of the clone holds the running
version under the running slot's uuids and its store matches the usrhash, slot b is empty, the first
drive's passphrase does not open the clone's persist, and the first drive's header over the clone's
data reads as no file system, so the two volume keys differ. After the poweroff qemu starts again with
only the clone. Its luks prompt refuses the first drive's passphrase and takes the clone's, the file is
in home, and the clone boots the version it was made from, from its own esp and slot a, with a machine
id of its own and none of the first drive's snapshots.

The drive: the vm app writes it from the image into a sparse file with rift-flash, with an exchange
partition when --exchange gives its size. Persist has to be luks2 with argon2id, the settings a person
gets, with every subvolume and the owner's home, and the exchange partition an exfat labelled EXCHANGE
of that size. A clone of the drive gets an exchange partition of the same size.

The slots: systemd-boot started the uki with a boot counter in its name, the boot reached
boot-complete.target and the counter is gone, systemd-sysupdate lists the running version as
installed, /usr runs from slot a, and slot b's two partitions are there and empty.

With --updates the vm gets a second drive, an ext4 file system labelled updates with the update files
of two newer versions: next (nix build .#update) and broken (nix build .#broken-update), a version
after next whose boot check always fails. After the other checks the test mounts next where
systemd-sysupdate reads updates and installs that version: its store and verity partitions in slot b
with the uuids from the file names, its uki on the esp with three tries. The vm reboots and the slots
are checked again for the new version: systemd-boot started its uki, the boot was marked good,
sysupdate lists both versions with the new one current, and /usr runs from slot b.

Then the rollback. sysupdate installs broken over the oldest version, in slot a, and the vm boots it
three times. Each of those boots comes up to the shell, the check fails, nothing marks the boot good,
and systemd-boot has taken one more try off its uki: +2-1, +1-2, +0-3. The fourth boot runs next from
slot b again, and sysupdate still lists broken as installed.

With --models the files in that directory go into the @models subvolume before boot. The test waits
on the system bus until quasard has loaded the model it picked for orbit's tier, checks that it is the
one in the directory, asks the local api for a short completion and asks quasar a question over the bus
and through `rift ai`.
The local api has to refuse the same completion when the request comes with a web page's Origin or
Host header, and the owner must not reach llama-server's socket behind it.

With --splash the test also takes a screendump through the qemu monitor while the luks prompt, or the
first boot's first question, is up and checks that Liftoff's boot screen is on it. The text style, the
default, is crates/liftoff-splash on its near black: the logo's ice in the block at the top left where
the logo is drawn, and systemd's green OK in the console under it. With --style graphical the drive
boots with plymouth.splash=liftoff-graphical, which a SMBIOS string hands systemd-stub for the kernel
command line, and the screen has the mark from nix/liftoff/logo in the middle of the same near black. The dump is saved as a png. --splash-only ends the test when the shell is up after
the splash.

With --desktop the test checks that greetd is up and takes a screendump of the running session: horizon
paints its background gray over the whole screen, a console would show black with text. The vm has a
virtio gpu for this, horizon renders on it in software.

With --lens the desktop check expects lens's bar along the top of that screen: horizon reports a
layer surface with its namespace, and the screendump has the bar gray with something drawn at its
left, in its middle and at its right, and the desktop gray below. `lens --state` prints what the bar
shows and the test compares its clock with `date` in the vm and its network with nmcli's. The test
then opens the Applications menu with `lens --menu`: under the field are the apps of the session in
their sections, typing an app's name with `lens --type` filters them, and `lens --enter` starts the
one that is selected, which horizon then lists as a window. The field takes lines from the serial
shell the same way: a nushell pipeline puts three rows under it, a command with arguments it does
not know puts a line under it, the first `lens --escape` clears the field and the second closes
the menu. After the lock screen's own checks a pointer click on the status icons opens the system
menu at the right of the bar: `lens --state` says the cable is connected and that the vm has no
wireless card, Bluetooth adapter, backlight or battery, a click on the volume slider changes what
`wpctl get-volume` reads, a second click on the icons closes the menu, Restart asks first and escape
says no, and Lock starts the lock screen, which the owner's password unlocks. Then notifications:
lens owns org.freedesktop.Notifications on the session bus, a critical one from notify-send stands
under the bar at the right in the screendump and stays until its close button closes it, a click on a
notification's button makes notify-send print the action's key, and one that is not critical goes
after five seconds and stays in the list. A click on the clock opens the clock menu, which lists it,
its Do not disturb switch keeps the next one off the screen, and a second click closes the menu. The
volume key sent over qmp turns the sink up and shows the key popup over the dock. Killing the shell
brings it back, since it is a user unit that restarts. Then Firefox and Ghostty, started from the dock,
stand side by side between the bar and the dock, each with the title bar it draws itself and a close
button at its right. KeePassXC, the first Qt app, started from the Applications menu, stands there with
the Adwaita title bar Qt draws for it in dark. The everyday apps follow, one at a time from the same menu:
pictures, documents, video, sound, the calculator, archives, the disks, where the space went and the
characters, each with the title bar it draws itself. A file of each kind names the app that owns it, and
the image viewer, given a photograph, draws it in colour between the bars. The owner's theme set to light
and the shell started again
make the bar, the dock, the desktop, the Applications menu, the lock screen and both apps light, and dark
again after that.
With --models as
well, a question goes through `lens --do`, which prints quasar's answer, and then into the field,
where the answer shows up as rows under it.
